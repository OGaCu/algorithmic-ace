### this is my note on testing

unit test: to verify individual functions or components can work correctly in isolation by testing specific inputs and expected outputs.

integration test: to check if multiple components work together properly by testing their interactions and data flow between integrated units. (more specifically function parameters and outputs)

system test: to evaluates the complete, integrated system against specified requirements by testing end-to-end functionality in a production-like environment. (limited in this repo)
